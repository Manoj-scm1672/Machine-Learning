# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning ðŸš—ðŸ“ˆ

This project presents an analysis and predictive modeling of car prices using machine learning techniques. The objective is to understand how different car features affect the price and to build a model that can accurately predict car prices based on these features.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `An_Analysis_of_Car_Price_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, visualizations, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and conclusions.
- `car data.csv`: Dataset used for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The dataset includes various attributes of cars such as:
- **Car Name**
- **Year**
- **Selling Price**
- **Present Price**
- **Kms Driven**
- **Fuel Type**
- **Seller Type**
- **Transmission**
- **Owner**

These features are used to predict the selling price of a car.

## ðŸ§  ML Techniques Used

The following machine learning models were implemented and compared:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

Each model was evaluated using metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- RÂ² Score

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

The project highlights the importance of feature engineering and model selection. Random Forest Regressor showed the best performance among all models evaluated.

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
